# fooling-around-with-php

For now this is just a project to fool around with. Testing things, ideas and
workflows. The goal of this project is to accumulate knowledge about basic PHP frameworks and tools such as Composer, Symfony ans Doctrine. This whole thing is probably not of any interest to anyone other than me, but I'll keep it public just in case it might accidently help someone.

## Instructions

Make sure you have `php` and `composer` installed

1. clone the repo
2. inside the `src/` directory run `composer install`
3. run `docker-compose up` from inside the project root
